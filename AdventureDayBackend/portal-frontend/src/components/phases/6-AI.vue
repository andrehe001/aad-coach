    <h2>Phase 6: Intelligence</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, we must realize that the Smoorghs still win too often and we can't buy back enough resources. Can you optimize our artificial players in the system so that we win more often?</p>
    <p>Goal: Optimize your artificial player bots and increase our change of winning!</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Even people sometimes have firmly established patterns</li>
      <li>Are Smoorghs human-like?</li>
      <li>The cloud has enough computing capacity for any algorithm or machine learning approach</li>
    </ul>
