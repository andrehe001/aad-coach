    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>It’s the year 2050. Cybercity is famous for its gaming scene. But not only humans live here, but also creatures from other galaxies. 
      At times it can be quite turbulent in the big arcades of the city. In particualar the extraterrestrial species called the Smoorghs - sleazy merchants - are looking for trouble. 
      They have stolen valuable resources from humans and are refusing to give them back. 
      Now the World Game Federation is trying to use the love which the Smoorghs developed for games over the years and asks different development teams in a competition to win back as much of the diamonds, gold and rare earths as possible using a virtual currency.</p>

    <p>The Smoorghs love the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Metal, Snap“ – so the World Game Federation has decided to this one.</p>
    <p>Smoorghs are very suspicious guys, so the World Game Federation had to have a third race in a distant galaxy develop a game engine. It was certified by the Council of Interstellar Judges and released as a blackbox - none of the parties has access to the source code behind it.</p>
    <p>The World Game Federation provides a bot to every team, especially to speed up the beginning.</p>
    <p>Hopefully we will still win often enough to generate enough profit...</p>
