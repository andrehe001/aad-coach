# Azure GameDay

## Vision
Azure GameDay is a team-centric, heavily story and gamification based, one day hands-on event giving attendees the opportunity for getting real experience in a safe, stressfull but also very rewarding environment. It naturally complements our existing offerings - Microsoft OpenHack, Microsoft Cloud Workshops and WhatTheHacks - in terms of duration and gamification aspects. It also completes our compete offerings against AWS with having an AWS GamyDay equivalent.

## Details

## Differentiation
We as Microsoft already have a couple of hackathon/team event formats for Azure:
* [Microsoft OpenHack](https://openhack.microsoft.com/)
* [Microsoft Cloud Workshop (MCW)](https://microsoftcloudworkshop.com/)
* [WhatTheHack](https://github.com/microsoft/whatthehack)

They all have the following in common:
* designed for 2-3 days
* specific around a scenario / a group of Azure services
* some of them have a narrative, and even if some have gamificiation aspects, it's not in the foreground.

## Voice of the Customer
In terms of , and also the [different learning methods of the generation Z](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sievakozinsky/2017/07/24/how-generation-z-is-shaping-the-change-in-education/) 


## Target Audience
The event will focus on DevOps aspects relevant independenly from the role like developer, infrastructure admin, operations team, or AI engineer.
It will also give the opportunity to dive into role specific side challenges.
The recommendation will be to have an Azure Fundamentals beginner level knowledge, which could be archived with [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) or the [Azure Fundamentals Online Learning Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/).

## Theme
The theme and thus also the narrative, the challenges and marketing materials will be around the [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock - Sample Application](https://github.com/microsoft/RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock), which was presented at [Microsoft Ignite 2019](https://aka.ms/DevKeynote) by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com) and friends.

## Milestones
1. Pilot delivery at Bosch in April
2. Second pilot delivery in May
3. Releasing it to the public agross CSAs, GBBs, WW Azure DL in June
4. Internal delivery at Ready, Las Vegas, in July

## Background
The term *GameDay* was coined by [Jesse Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Robbins) when he worked at Amazon as Master of Disaster and was responsible for availability. Jesse created GameDays with the goal of increasing reliability by purposefully creating major failures on a regular basis. They also help facilitate the value of Chaos Engineering. Typically, a GameDay would run between 2-4 hours, and involve a team of engineers who either develop an application, or support it, but ideally it involved members from both sides of an application.

The idea of GameDays also has catched up with other scenarios as availability and is also be used as an effective training mechanism beside Chaos Engineering to simulate systems, process, and team responses. Having GameDays specific for security, performance, scalabilty, cost optimization, or operations in general can bring a hughe value to the teams, processes and applications involved.
