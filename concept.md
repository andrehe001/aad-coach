# Azure Adventure Day

## Vision
Azure Adventure Day is a team-centric, heavily story and gamification based, one-day hands-on event giving attendees the opportunity for getting real experience in a safe, stressful but also very rewarding environment. It naturally complements our existing offerings - Microsoft OpenHack, Microsoft Cloud Workshops and WhatTheHacks - in terms of duration and gamification aspects. It also completes our compete offerings against AWS with having an AWS GameDay equivalent.

## Details
The participants will be distributed in teams of 4 with a total attendee count of min. 12 and max. 48.
Depending on the number of participants there will be between 2 and 4 coaches / SMEs.
A rough agenda could look like:
* 9:00am - 9:30am Registration/Game Rules (30 Min)
* 9:30am - 11:30am Game Play (120 Min)
* 11:30am - 12:30am Lunch (60 Min)
* 12:30am - 2:30pm Game Play (120 Min)
* 2:30pm - 3:00pm Reflection and Closing (30 Min)

The Game Play itself will have a six-phase narrative around Deployment, Scaling, Change Management, Monitoring, Security, and Cost Optimization.
A Leaderboard at the front will always show how many points each team have.
The score calculation will be based on a couple of metrics also visible to the teams: Requests/s, Availability, Latency, Azure Costs/h, Game Revenue, etc.

An instructor system will be deployed beforehand and run during the event to facilitate the phases and leaderboard functionality.

## Differentiation
We as Microsoft already have a couple of hackathon/team event formats for Azure:
* [Microsoft OpenHack](https://openhack.microsoft.com/)
* [Microsoft Cloud Workshop (MCW)](https://microsoftcloudworkshop.com/)
* [WhatTheHack](https://github.com/microsoft/whatthehack)

They all have the following in common:
* designed for 2-3 days
* specific around a scenario / a group of Azure services
* some of them have a narrative, and even if some have gamification aspects, it's not in the foreground.

## Voice of the Customer
In terms of limit availability of technical engineers, cost savings, tight schedules, and also the [different learning methods of the generation Z](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sievakozinsky/2017/07/24/how-generation-z-is-shaping-the-change-in-education/) we got the following feedback from customers:
* *"we would love to see a one-day event, 2-3 days are too much from an organizational and cost perspective"*
* *"I need a hackathon I can sent all my team members to, I don't have the time and budget to send them to individual training events in this early project stage"*
* *"we are getting very great feedback regarding attendees from AWS GameDays and we would love to have something similar for Azure"*

## Target Audience
The event will focus on DevOps aspects relevant independently from the role like developer, infrastructure admin, operations team, or AI engineer.
It will also give the opportunity to dive into role specific side challenges.
The recommendation will be to have an Azure Fundamentals beginner level knowledge, which could be archived with [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) or the [Azure Fundamentals Online Learning Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/).

## Theme
The theme and thus also the narrative, the challenges and marketing materials will be around the [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock - Sample Application](https://github.com/microsoft/RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock), which was presented at [Microsoft Ignite 2019](https://aka.ms/DevKeynote) by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com) and friends.

## Milestones
1. Pilot delivery at Bosch in April
2. Second pilot delivery in May (cloud native day in cologne on the 5th of May with 60 people?)
3. Releasing it to the public across CSAs, GBBs, WW Azure DL in June
4. Internal delivery at Ready, Las Vegas, in July

## Background
The term *GameDay* was coined by [Jesse Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Robbins) when he worked at Amazon as Master of Disaster and was responsible for availability. Jesse created GameDays with the goal of increasing reliability by purposefully creating major failures on a regular basis. They also help facilitate the value of Chaos Engineering. Typically, a GameDay would run between 2-4 hours, and involve a team of engineers who either develop an application, or support it, but ideally it involved members from both sides of an application.

The idea of GameDays also has catched up with other scenarios as availability and is be used as an effective training mechanism beside Chaos Engineering to simulate systems, process, and team responses. Having GameDays specific for security, performance, scalability, cost optimization, or operations in general can bring a huge value to the teams, processes and applications involved.
